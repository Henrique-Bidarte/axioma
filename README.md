Unreal Enigne has released a free pack with over 500 beautiful animations for motion matching. But unfortunately, they did not finish some functions and promised to do it by the version of the engine 5.5. But some craftsmen did not wait and made the project the way users would like to see it.

In my version of the project, crouch, sprint, walking of artificial intelligence with parkour are added, all functions of the overlay system project (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMdUPLuL6sI), the ragdoll system are added, and replication is also added. Thus, the project is completely ready for use in both multiplayer and singleplayer games.

To start using the project, you need to:
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/Sharik2468/ALS-V5-Replicated
2. Rebuild the project either from the source (right-click on the file .uproject -> Generate visual studio files -> Start building), or when you start ue itself recompiles the data.
3. The project is ready for use.
